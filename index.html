            several <br> charges against him. In a now-exclusive interview with ABP from inside the jail, Lawrence
            Bishnoi has issued an open threat to actor Salman Khan.The gangster expressed, "There is anger in our
            society for Salman Khan. He humiliated my society. A case was filed against him but he did not
            apologise. If
            he does not tender an apology, be ready to face the consequences. I will not depend on anyone
            else.”"There
            is anger in my mind for him since childhood. Will break his ego sooner or later. He should come to our
            deity's temple (Jambeshwarji temple) and apologise. If our society forgives, then I will not say
            anything,"
            Lawrence added. Reportedly the Bishnoi community has been worshipping blackbuck since their traditional
            history.Recalling the 1988 incident, Salman hunted a blackbuck during the shoots of his film 'Hum Saath
            Saath Hain'. Blackbuck is a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act, of 1972. The actor was
            even
            sentenced to five years in jail in a case filed by the Bishnoi community and heard by a Jodhpur court.
            However, he was granted bail soon after and major charges against him were dropped in 2022.On the work
            front, Salman last month concluded hosting his TV show Bigg Boss 16 and was seen making a cameo in SRK
            starrer Pathaan. His last film was 2018’s Antim on the big screen with an interesting lineup arriving.
